# SAP
Super Awesome Packages!
Created and maintained by the FSFE Community.

## Install
Download and run the [installer](https://github.com/Liamtheperson123/SAP/releases/tag/Installer).
The installer will walk you through installation. When/if a desktop icon appears, installation was successful!

If not, you can attempt manually setting up the python files, and setting the "PATH" (Walkthrough in progress)

## Usage
Open a Terminal or PowerShell window, and type "sap install [package name]" Example; "sap install vlc"
Same for uninstalls; "sap uninstall vlc"

A basic help menu can be accessed via "sap -h"

## Why?
SAP's purpose is to both, cut the web browser out of downloading software on windows, and increase efficency.
Downloading software through a terminal without having to navigate a web browsers interface is multitudes faster, and more satisfying.

# Updates
Updates to SAP itself will be infrequent, but repository package updates will be as frequent as possible.
*Package repository updates require no local downloads.*
